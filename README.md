## Valorant Agent Picker

This is a simple Python application that allows you to randomly select Valorant agents for your gameplay. The application provides a GUI built using the Tkinter library.

### How It Works

The application displays images of all the available Valorant agents in a grid layout. You can click on the images to select agents and roll for a random agent from the selected pool.

Each time you click the "Roll" button, a new random agent will be selected.

If you change your mind and want to clear the agent selection, you can click the "Clear" button, which removes all the selected agents and resets the GUI.
